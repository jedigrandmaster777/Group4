	We decided to paint the water level changes of the Great Salt Lake because it is a current problem that our community faces. In Utah we divert water from the canyons away from the Great Salt Lake for agricultural purposes. Along with the rise in global temperatures and the increase in droughts we see the Great Salt Lake losing water annually. While the Great Salt Lake has had years with high water levels, they are becoming less frequent. With the lake drying up more dust, containing heavy metals like lead and mercury and arsenic, is being released into the air. This causes the air quality to become even worse in the Salt Lake area. Humans are not the only things affected by these water levels; birds and brine shrimp have been deeply affected. With lower water levels the lake’s salinity increases which is bad for the algae that brine shrimps and flies feed on. As of March 10, there was 105 grams of salt per liter in the lake. This decrease in algae also leads to a decrease in brine shrimp and flies. Birds like the eared grebe rely on the brine shrimp for a source of food and during the fall they eat around 20,000 to 30,000 shrimp per day. When there are fewer shrimp not as many birds can be sustained by the lake’s resources. Birds are also affected sole by the decrease of water in the lake and surrounding wetlands. We can see that this is a large problem in our local community.
